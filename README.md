# Meteora DLMM Pool Visualizer

This project is a Next.js application that visualizes Decentralized Liquidity Market Maker (DLMM) pools for the Meteora protocol. It provides an interactive cityscape representation of pool data and detailed information about individual pools.

## Features

- Interactive cityscape visualization of DLMM pools
- Detailed view of individual pool statistics
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Server-side rendering for improved performance and SEO

## Technologies Used

- Next.js 13+ (with App Router)
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/bibhu-padhy/bucketshop.git
   cd bucketshop
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add any necessary environment variables.

   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## Usage

- The home page displays a cityscape visualization of all DLMM pools.
- Click on a building to view detailed information about a specific pool.
- Use the zoom and pan controls to navigate the cityscape.
- On the detail page, use the back button to return to the main view.

## Deployment

This project can be deployed on platforms that support Next.js applications, such as Vercel or Netlify. Follow the platform-specific instructions for deploying a Next.js app.

# City Block Interface for DLMM Pools

## Concept Overview

The City Block Interface is an innovative visualization approach for representing DLMM (Decentralized Liquidity Market Maker) pools and their associated data. This interface transforms complex financial information into an intuitive, engaging cityscape metaphor.

## Key Elements

1. **Layout**

   - Bird's-eye view of a city block with isometric or 2.5D graphics
   - Each building represents a different pool
   - Building size correlates to Total Value Locked (TVL)
   - Streets between buildings show connections between pools

2. **Building Design**

   - Architectural styles represent pool types (e.g., skyscrapers for high-volume pools)
   - Number of floors could represent pool age or another metric
   - Windows light up based on activity levels
   - Rooftop elements indicate special features or statuses

3. **Street Activity**

   - Animated vehicles or people show token flow
   - Traffic density represents trading volume
   - Street width indicates the strength of relationships between pools

4. **Day/Night Cycle**

   - Represents market hours
   - Lighting effects highlight active pools during "night" hours
   - Sunrise/sunset transitions for opening/closing of certain markets

5. **Weather Effects**

   - Metaphor for market conditions (e.g., sunny for bull markets, rainy for bear markets)
   - Fog represents uncertainty or low liquidity periods

6. **Interactive Elements**

   - Click/tap on buildings for detailed pool information
   - Zoom functionality to focus on specific areas or view the entire "city"
   - Filters to show pools based on specific metrics

7. **Real-time Updates**

   - Animate building growth/shrinkage for TVL changes
   - Subtle effects (e.g., steam from manholes) show recent transactions

8. **Customization**

   - "Construct" new buildings when creating pools
   - Rearrange city layout based on user preferences

9. **Alerts and Notifications**

   - Emergency vehicles represent alerts or significant events

10. **Comparative Tools**
    - Split-screen view to compare different "city blocks" (e.g., DLMMs or time periods)

## Implementation Considerations

1. Use SVG for the basic city block layout
2. Leverage D3.js or Three.js for advanced animations and interactivity
3. Implement a data binding system for real-time updates
4. Create smooth transitions for all cityscape changes
5. Optimize performance, especially for mobile devices
6. Conduct user testing to refine metaphors and ensure intuitive navigation

## Accessibility

- Provide an alternative list or table view for screen reader compatibility
- Use distinct color schemes and patterns for colorblind-friendly design
- Include text labels and tooltips for all visual elements

## Benefits

- Fresh, engaging way to interact with DLMM pool data
- Transforms complex financial information into a familiar visual landscape
- Intuitive exploration of data relationships
- Potential to attract a wider range of users and increase platform engagement

## Next Steps

1. Create detailed mockups of the cityscape and individual elements
2. Develop a basic prototype to test core concepts
3. Conduct user testing and gather feedback
4. Iterate on the design based on user insights
5. Implement a full-scale version with real-time data integration
